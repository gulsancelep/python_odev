Exercise 6
Follow the stpes:

First, def a function called cube that takes an argument called number.
Make that function return the cube of that number (i.e. that number multiplied by itself and multiplied by itself once again).
Define a second function called by_three that takes an argument called number.
if that number is divisible by 3,by_threeshould call cube(number) and return its result. Otherwise, by_three should return False. -Check if it works.
